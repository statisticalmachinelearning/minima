The Statistical Machine Learning Textbook is a resource intended for readers interested in a concise mathematically rigorous introdution to statistical machine learning literature. A major objective of this advanced undergraduate textbook is to introduce a modular theory-based design strategy for supporting the mathematical analysis and design of machine learning algorithms.
